# RLSS Cooperative

The RLSS Cooperative (NoToRa Coop) is a group of RL Sideswipe Discord server owners and moderators who work together to promote positivity in the game's community. By working together, helping each other out, and handling server punishments across several large servers, the coop makes sure that toxicity, racism, homophobia, and other undesirable traits are does not receive a platform.

This bot is developed to make these cross-server punishments easier. It does this by handling bans and other punishments automatically across all servers when triggered in only one. Rather than needing to ban the user manually on all servers, this automates the process and greatly improves efficiency and ease of use, ensuring the objectives of NoToRa Coop are successful.
